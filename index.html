                <p class="content__type">
                    In a world where racism still exists, there are many people who are proud to be different and stand up for their rights.

                    These people are brave enough to challenge the status quo and fight for what is right, even when it is difficult.
                    
                    They refuse to be silenced by prejudice and discrimination, and they work tirelessly to create a more just and equal society.
                    
                    One of the ways that people are getting rid of racism is by educating themselves and others about its harmful effects.
                    
                    They are learning about the history of racism and how it has impacted different communities, and they are using this knowledge to inform their actions.
                    
                    By understanding the roots of racism, they are better equipped to combat it in all its forms.
                    
                   
                </p>
               
                <h2 class="content__headline">All perfect</h2>
                <p class="content__type">
                    Another way that people are fighting racism is by being proud of who they are and celebrating their cultural heritage.
                    
                    They are not ashamed of their skin color, religion, or background, but rather, they embrace it and use it as a source of strength.
                    
                    By being proud of their identity, they are sending a powerful message that diversity is something to be celebrated, not feared.
                    
                    Many people are also working to create safe spaces where individuals from different backgrounds can come together and share their experiences.
                    
                    These spaces provide an opportunity for people to learn from each other and build bridges across cultural divides.
                    
                    By listening to each other's stories and perspectives, they are able to develop empathy and understanding, which is critical in the fight against racism.
                    
                    Some people are using art and culture as a tool to combat racism.
                    
                    They are using music, film, literature, and other forms of art to challenge stereotypes and promote positive representations of marginalized communities.
                    
                    Through their creative work,

                    Change and development were dammed back by invincible
                    dams for ever. But the Modern Utopia must be not static but kinetic,
                    must shape not as a permanent state but as a hopeful stage, leading
                    to a long ascent of stages.

                <p class="content__type">
                    Nowadays we do not resist and overcome
                    the great stream of things, but rather float upon it. We build now
                    not citadels, but ships of state. For one ordered arrangement of
                    citizens rejoicing in an equality of happiness safe and assured
                    to them and their children for ever, we have to plan "a flexible
                    common compromise, in which a perpetually novel succession of
                    individualities may converge most effectually upon a comprehensive
                    onward development."
